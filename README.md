# Open-Maps
The Open Maps project is a navigation app where I developed navigations apps to navigate between UIC building and East campus using footpaths. I was able to perform back-end operations using the language of C++ to load the map, build the graph, and calculate the shortest path between two locations. I created an adjacency maitrix by rebuilding the graph class from scratch to properly outputing the vertices and edges. I Constructed Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between two UIC buildings. I explored the possibility of finding a “good” spot for two people to meet up by building an underlying graph
